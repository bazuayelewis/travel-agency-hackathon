## Overview
This project is a submission by team-3(Data Natives) for the DEC countries_information_ingestion hackathon where data is extracted from a REST API to a data lake, transformed and loaded into a data warehouse.

## Setup Instructions


### Setting up GCS Bucket

### Creating a Service Account


### Inserting your Configurations


### Setting up BigQuery


## Transformation Logic


## Testing the Pipeline

## Testing the API Endpoint  
A FastAPI implementation was included to perform inference on the loaded dataset to help answer the questions raised in the task's description.    
  
To start the API application, simply run the command below from the project parent directory.  
  
```BASH
python api/main.py
```  
  
This starts the application on port 8000, as shown in the screenshot below.  

![API Server Startup](./screenshots/api_server_startup.PNG)  
  
To access the endpoints from the browser, open the page `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the Swagger UI. This opens up a page similar to the image below.  
  
![Swagger UI](./screenshots/swagger_ui.PNG)  
  
You can test all the endpoints from the Swagger UI.

## Analysis/ Insights
The data was used to answer the following questions.

1. **How many countries speak french?**
    ```python
    # Filter for countries where 'languages' column contains 'French'

    french_speaking_countries = df[df['languages'].fillna('').str.contains('French')]

    # Display the results
    print("Number of countries that speak French:", len(french_speaking_countries))
Number of countries that speak French: 46

2. **How many countries speak English?**
   ```python
   # Filter for countries where 'languages' column contains 'English'

    english_speaking_countries = df[df['languages'].fillna('').str.contains('English')]

    # Display the results
    print("Number of countries that speak English:", len(english_speaking_countries))
Number of countries that speak English: 91

3. **How many countries have more than one official language?**
    ```python
   # Count countries with more than one official language
    more_than_one_offLan = df[df['languages'].fillna('').str.contains(',')]

Number of countries with more that one official language: 96

4. **How many countries have the Euro as their official currency?**
   ```python
   # Count countries with Euro as official currency
    num_countries_with_euro = df[df['currency_name'] == 'Euro'].shape[0]

    # Display the results
    print("Number of countries with Euro as official currency:", num_countries_with_euro)
Number of countries with Euro as official currency: 36

    continent_counts = continent_counts.rename(columns={'count': 'No of countries'})
    
    # Count distinct continents
    num_distinct_continents = len(continent_counts)
    
    # Display results
    print("Number of distinct continents:", num_distinct_continents)
